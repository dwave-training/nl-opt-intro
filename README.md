# nl-opt-intro
This Github repository contains exercises to help users understand the basics of how to run D-Wave's Nonlinear Model and Nonlinear Solver.

# Exercise 1
Open "NL Solver Basics.ipynb" and follow the instructions to minimze the equation $y = i^2 - 4i$.

# Exercise 2
Open "NL Solver-Constraints.ipynb" and follow the instructions to create a simple model with an objective and two constraints.

# Exercises 3 and 4

Open "NL Solver-Data Types-Set and List.ipynb" and follow the instructions.
